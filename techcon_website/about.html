            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The TechCon conference has been run by different groups during its history.
                 Previously it was organised as part of the UK Radio Festival, under The Radio 
                 Academy. Since 2016 it has been run independently by TBC Media Ltd. due to limited 
                 resources at The Radio Academy <br><br>

TBC Media Ltd. is run by Ann Charles and Aradhna Tayal, who are former committee members of TechCon
 from its Radio Festival days. TBC Media Ltd. exists to support the UK radio and audio industry by 
 running events to support the technical community, most notably Radio TechCon.</p>

            <h3>David Lloyd – Radio TechCon Host</h3>
            <p>Former commercial radio executive turned radio consultant, historian and broadcaster, 
                David has been in radio for over forty
                 years, running stations of all formats from Galaxy to Century, LBC to Virgin.

            <h3>Angie Avilanos – Manager, BFBS Live Events</h3>
            <p>Angie’s been staging live shows for British forces for over two decades — usually 
                somewhere hot, cold, or just plain inhospitable. <br>

After 10 years at the BBC, she swapped studios for sandbags and hasn’t looked back (well, maybe once
 or twice). Nothing makes her happier than seeing a crowd forget where they are — even if it’s in 
 the middle of a desert, muddy field, or concrete jetty.</p>
